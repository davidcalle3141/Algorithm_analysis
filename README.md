##Algorithm Analysis sorting algorithm project

Introduction:
 Sorting routines are among the most widely used and studied algorithms. Every
student should know how to implement several different kinds of sorts, and should have
idea about how they perform, both theoretically and practically. This programming
project is designed to give the student practice in implementing and observing the
behavior of four sorts: Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, and Quick Sort. 


Program Execution:
 Your program should read in data from Num8.txt, run Insertion Sort on it, and
store its results; read in data from Num16.txt, run Insertion Sort on it, and store its results,
etc., up through file Num16284.
 Next it should repeat the process, using Merge Sort, Heap Sort, and Quick Sort as
the sorting routines.
 When your program terminates, you should have 48 sets of results. Each set of
results should contain:
(1) the value of count immediately prior the termination of the algorithm,
(2) the array after having been sorted by your sort routine
